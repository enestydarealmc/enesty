A.For the case when O_SYNC is disabled:
1. When linux buffer size is 1 byte:
real    0m0.013s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.005s
2. When linux buffer size is 1024 bytes:
real    0m0.001s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.000s

In the first case the time is much bigger compared to the second one simply because the lesser buffer size, the more read and write system
calls it takes to copy the testfile.ico

B>For the case when O_SYNC is enabled"
1. When linux buffer size is 1 byte:
real    0m6.078s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.272s
2. When linux buffer size is 1024 bytes:
real    0m0.019s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.000s

Compared to when O_SYNC is turned off, this is much slower. It is because O_SYNC makes sure that both the content of the file being copied
and its metadata is in the disk, only then it returns, which makes both the I/O time and kernel cpu time much bigger.
