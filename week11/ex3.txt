We notice that the default buffer mode of Linux is line buffer, which means it only outputs data when it 
encounters new line or is full

In the first program, the string "Hello" did not fill up the buffer, nor did it contain new line character,
so of course it has not been printed out yet.
Then we fork the process, right after which the new line character is printed, causing the 2 buffers (parent 
and child processes') to be flushed, so we get two "Hello\n" strings printed consecutively.

In the second one, firstly we print "Hello\n", which consists of new line character therefore get printed
right away.
Then we fork, with the two buffers (of child and parent processes) being empty. After that the two buffers
receive a "\n" for each and print them out immediately. Finally we get Hello string above two new lines.
